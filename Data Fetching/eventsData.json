I left feeling I had lived a new way of practising yoga and meditation, an eager to explore and practice more. I totally recommend Ruairí´s sessions, and hope to be able to keep practising with him. Diana: I really enjoy the kundalini yoga class, I felt more relaxed and lighter after class, it was a new experience for me, so interactive, mixing yoga with breathing exercises.

A school gives us the opportunity to come together as a collective with the dual objective of working on the material and working on ourselves. Through the group we give ourselves a chance to change, transform and most notably, provide a space to awaken and become conscious. A movement practice will provide the platform and broad range of material to contend with. In taking part in a movement school like this I’ll aim to teach material that will help you foster a lifelong movement practice that is independent in its own way and truly unique to you as an individual. We come together as a group to share that unique perspective and elevate our own understanding of movement as part of a community. The school will follow a curriculum based approach in exposing students to what I feel are fundamental practices (listed below) that relate to the field of movement. The teachings will be delivered in an organised, modular and process-based approach in order to present these various systems as a coherent body of knowledge.

A school gives us the opportunity to come together as a collective with the dual objective of working on the material and working on ourselves. Through the group we give ourselves a chance to change, transform and most notably, provide a space to awaken and become conscious. A movement practice will provide the platform and broad range of material to contend with. In taking part in a movement school like this I’ll aim to teach material that will help you foster a lifelong movement practice that is independent in its own way and truly unique to you as an individual. We come together as a group to share that unique perspective and elevate our own understanding of movement as part of a community. The school will follow a curriculum based approach in exposing students to what I feel are fundamental practices (listed below) that relate to the field of movement. The teachings will be delivered in an organised, modular and process-based approach in order to present these various systems as a coherent body of knowledge.

Plus, you can customize either the responses of the model or the model itself with your own enterprise data. We'll walk through Amazon Bedrock, which offers a choice of high-performing foundation models, and show how you can customize those FMs with your own data. In this hands-on session, I will guide you through how you can use any foundational model and perform pre-training/continuous training using Bedrock and implement Retriever-Answer Generator (RAG) using Aurora as a vector store in Python.
